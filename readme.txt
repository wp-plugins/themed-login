Makes WordPress login, registration and password retrieval pages totally themeable using WP theme mechanism. 

== Description ==

Themed login makes it possible to change the look of default Wordpress login system using 
templates located at your theme folder, not just CSS-level customizations:

*    Login - login.php
*    Lost password form - retrievepassword.php
*    Registration - register.php
*   Registration confirmation - registered.php
If your theme does not contain one of the files described above - that is not a big deal, 
WordPress's defaults will be used. See usage examples in "examples" plugin directory.
